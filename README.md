# Tech Interview Prep (JavaScript)

This repository is a collection of notes I have taken for data structures and algorithms in JavaScript while studying for technical interviews.

Included are also solutions to interview problems in [Coderust](https://www.educative.io/courses/coderust-hacking-the-coding-interview), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and the book [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://www.amazon.ca/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836) by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash.

Topics covered are as follows:

1) Dynamic Programming
2) Arrays
3) Strings
4) Trees
5) Graphs
6) Linked Lists
7) Stacks and Queues
8) Backtracking
